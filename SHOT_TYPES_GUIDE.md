# Comprehensive Cinematography Guide

This application now includes comprehensive collections of both cinematographic shot types and camera motion techniques, each organized into detailed categories with explanations to help users understand when and how to use them effectively.

## Shot Types

## Categories Overview

### üßç‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Framing Based on Subject Size
These define how much of the subject is visible in the frame:
- **Extreme Wide Shot (EWS)** - Subject barely visible, establishes environment
- **Wide Shot (WS) / Long Shot (LS)** - Full body visible, places subject in environment
- **Medium Wide Shot (MWS)** - From knees up, balances subject and setting
- **Medium Shot (MS)** - From waist up, most common conversational shot
- **Medium Close-Up (MCU)** - From chest/shoulders up, ideal for dialogue
- **Close-Up (CU)** - Focuses on face or detail, shows emotion
- **Extreme Close-Up (ECU)** - Very small detail, used for emphasis

### üîÅ Camera Movement Shots
These describe how the camera moves to follow, reveal, or emphasize:
- **Pan** - Horizontal rotation from fixed point
- **Tilt** - Vertical rotation from fixed point
- **Zoom In/Out** - Lens zooms, camera doesn't move
